# [Project 1 : Mathematical modeling of oleoresin extraction from ginger](https://github.com/bahategar/Prasimulation-For-Oleorecin-Extraction-From-Ginger)
* The modeling aims to extract oleoresin from ginger with reactive solid-liquid extraction process
* Using Python to estimate distribution of concentration of oleoresin at various times and positions in ginger and solvent
* Mathematical modeling is carried out for the initial planning of the research

# [Project 2 : Mathemical Modeling for Simulation]()
* Built model of mathematic for simulation of fluid flow in pipe with heater on the surface of pipe
* Using Python to estimate distribution of temperature of fluid at various position in axial and radial
